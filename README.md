# Fierdy Pandu Data Analytics Portfolio
 
Hi! I'm Fierdy Pandu Setiawan, you can call me Pandu. I will guide you through my Portfolio from here.

## About

I have an academic background and hold a Bachelor of Communication Sciences degree in Communication Sciences (Pasundan University, Bandung). Previously a Promotion/Marketing Staff in Sharp Corporation, an electronic products manufacturing company based in Japan for 1 year. My passions in technology, data, and information, and how all of those combined have become crucial in the current global trend, drive me to self-taught programming without a prior Computer related background.

With my previous background that handles communication and communicating ideas, Planning and Organizing events and promotional events to gain brand awareness, and leading teams combined with skills that I have gained such as programming and Data Analyst from various sources either by self-taught or through courses I can leverage data analytical skills to improve corporate performance.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
